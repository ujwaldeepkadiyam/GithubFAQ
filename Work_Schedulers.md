## ✅ Tools that support full-day scheduling + reminders / time-blocks

### **TickTick**

* TickTick lets you plan tasks with exact times and even view them in a calendar-style day/week view. ([Focuzed][1])
* You can set reminders for tasks (start time, due time, recurring) so that you get alerted when it’s time to start — and if you don’t complete the task, the reminder stays/overdue status helps you notice. ([Google Play][2])
* Works on Web, Windows/Mac (desktop or browser), Android — so works across PC + phone. ([PlanWiz][3])
  **Good if:** you want day-scheduling + reminders + cross-device sync + ability to handle many tasks/projects.

---

### **Structured** (Day-Planner / Time-blocking tool)

* Structured lets you split your day into “time blocks” or “slots” and visualize in a timeline (calendar-style), which matches exactly your need: schedule start & end times for tasks. ([structured.app][4])
* You can plan the whole day in the morning, see all slots lined up, and get reminders as per your schedule. ([structured.app][4])
* Good for people juggling many different kinds of tasks (work, reading, personal, study) and wanting a clear “day-at-a-glance” layout.
  **Good if:** you prefer a timeline (hour-by-hour) view for your day — more like a planner than a simple to-do list.

---

### **Any.do**

* Any.do, while simpler, allows you to schedule tasks with due-dates and time-based reminders. ([Any.do][5])
* If you don’t need heavy features or complex scheduling — just basic day-plans + reminders — Any.do may suffice.
  **Good if:** you prefer minimal setup, straightforward interface, and simplicity.

---

### **Combination of Calendar + To-Do Apps (e.g. calendar + reminders strategy)**

You can also use calendar-based planning tools (like Google Calendar or any standard calendar) together with a to-do app (TickTick / Any.do). The workflow could be:

* Plan your day in the morning (slots in Calendar or Structured)
* Use a to-do/reminder app for alerts and due-time reminders
* Helps track both **start times** and **deadlines / end times**

This is less “all-in-one” but gives flexibility.

---

## ⚠️ What to check when picking such tools

* Can you assign **exact start and end times** (not just “due date/time”)?
* Does the app support **reminders at start and/or due (end)**?
* Cross-device sync (PC + Android) — important if you use both laptop and phone.
* Visual day-planner/timeline or calendar view — helps if you have many blocks in a day.
* Flexibility — for recurring tasks, varied tasks (study, work, personal), and overlapping time-blocks.

---

## 🎯 My Recommendation for you (Based on your habit)

Since you said:

> you forget important work because you spend a lot of time browsing on laptop

You need **scheduling + enforced reminders + cross-device sync + visual clarity**.

So I recommend trying **TickTick** first — it’s powerful, flexible, and widely used.
If you like visual day-planning, try **Structured**.

If you prefer simplicity, **Any.do** can work as a lightweight option.

## ✅ Good free (or freemium) tools for task scheduling & reminders

### **Todoist**

* Powerful and flexible to-do / task-management app — works on Windows, Web, Android, iOS. ([Todoist][1])

* Works well if you have many tasks/projects (study schedule, work, personal) and want to keep them all organized. ([Zapier][2])

### **TickTick**

* A to-do + schedule + calendar + reminders app — also includes timers (Pomodoro-style) to help you actually *do* the work. ([TickTick][3])
* Good if you want both planning and time-boxing (for example: 30 min reading, 45 min work). ([TickTick][3])
* Works across devices — PC / Web + Android — so you get sync everywhere. ([TickTick][3])

* Lets you set tasks, track the time spent, plan tasks in time-boxed “blocks,” and reflect on work done. ([Super Productivity][5])
* Good if you want more control — offline, privacy-friendly, and no cloud lock-in. ([Super Productivity][5])

---

## 🎯 Which of these suit *you* (given your habits)?

Since you mentioned:

> “I work in front of laptop a lot and sometimes forget important work because I spend a lot of time browsing … I want scheduling + reminders + cross-device.”

* If you want **simple scheduling + reminders** → **Any.do** or **Todoist**
* If you want **scheduling + timers + focus sessions** → **TickTick**

## 🎯 Quick recommendation (based on your use-case)

Since you told me:

> “I work in front of a laptop a lot and sometimes forget important work because I spend a lot of time browsing; I want scheduling + reminders + cross device (PC + Android).”

Here’s what I’d recommend:

* **Primary daily tool (free + simple):** Microsoft To Do — easy, minimal setup, always free.
* **If you want focus/time-boxing + avoid distractions:** TickTick — because of the built-in Pomodoro timer and habit tracking.
* **If you need project-level organization (for your GCP, ML, theology notes, etc.):** Todoist — very flexible for many tasks and recurring projects.
* **If you want a minimal app for quick errands / small tasks:** Any.do or Google Tasks.
* **If you juggle multiple projects at once and like visual boards:** Trello.

---

## ⚠️ What to expect in free plans

* Most free tools give **basic reminders, due-dates, lists** — enough for everyday scheduling.
* Some **advanced features** (calendar-views, advanced reminders, collaboration, analytics) often require paid plans.
* Free versions are usually **fine for personal use**, but may feel limited if you try to scale them for heavy project-management or team workflows.

## 🎯 Which one suits you best (given you often work on laptop and get distracted)?

* If you want a **powerful but simple personal task manager** → Todoist or Any.do.

* More advanced features (complex project workflows, analytics, large collaborations) may require paid plans. ([Lemon.io][6])
* Because they work in browser, they sync across devices — good for laptop + Android.
